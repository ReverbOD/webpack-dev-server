# webpack-dev-server
a boilerplate for a webpack dev server for a automatic and real-time compiling

I've used:
* [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/) - static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. I've used with a dev server to see a real time modification.
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - A JS Transpiller.
* [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) - ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems.
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - A code formatter.
* [Airbnb](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/)  A JS style guide.
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world (CSS with superpower :wink:).

## How to use:
* 1- Clone this repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/ReverbOD/webpack-dev-server.git`
* 2- Install all the dependencies: `$ yarn install`
* 3- Build your own app!
  
## Command:
* `$ npm run start` for building in dev mode
